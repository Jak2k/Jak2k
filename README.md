## Thoughts about ...

- ... **_Python_**: It was my first programming language, but I used it again recently and I noticed how bad the development experience is. Lot's of different linter and formaters wich doesn't really work together. Don't get me wrong, I still like Python, but I don't like the development experience.
- ... **_Java_**: It's a weird thing for people who don't know Typescript.
- ... **_Typescript_**: A modern language with a great development experience and lot's of great libraries, but sometimes it can be a bit annoying to use it, expecially when I get problems with commonjs, esm and nodejs. (And vercel)
- ... **_VSCode_**: It's a great editor, but sometimes it's a bit slow. (Check out [Codebox](https://github.com/jak2k/codebox))
- ... **_Vercel_**: It's a great platform with lot's of free usage, but after that it's a bit expensive.
- ... **_Github_**: It's a great platform, but owned by Microsoft. Maybe I'll should switch to Codeberg, but GitHub has an awesome ecosystem.
- ... **_Discord_**: It's a good platform, but everything is closed source.
- ... **_Windows_**: A cursed operating system with lot's of very old code. I prefer Linux.
- ... **_Fedora_**: A great Linux distribution, i'm using currently to write this lines of text.
- ... **_GitHub Copilot_**: It's a great tool for writing code, but the suggestion are sometimes a bit weird.
- ... **_Firefox_**: A okay browser, but it doesn't have the most modern APIs and misses a fex features in the developer tools. I use it on my pc.
- ... **_Chrome_**: A great browser, but it's owned by Google. I use a security hardened version (Vanadium) on my phone.
- ... **_Brave_**: A great browser, but too much crypto scam.
- ... **_Microsoft_**: The create great open source software, but they also create üí© like Windows or Office 365.
- ... **_Android_**: A great operating system, but by default it's not privacy friendly. I use GrapheneOS on my phone.
- ... **_Libre Office_**: A good office suite, but it's ugly.
- ... **_Libre Office Impress_** & **_Powerpoint_**: [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) is better for people with coding experience.
- ... **_Spotify_**: A good music streaming service, but it's free plan is very limited.
- ... **_YouTube Music_**: A good music streaming service, but also not perfect.
- ... **_ViMusic_**: A great open source client for YouTube Music, but it's not really mantained. I use it on my phone.
- ... **_Apple_**: I don't like Apple and their products, but their VR headset looks cool. (Oh, and they don't really care about privacy. They are even more intransparent than Google.)
- ... **_Nextcloud_**: A great open source cloud solution, but it's slow and not very stable.
- ... **_Obsidian_**: A great note taking app, but it's not open source.
- ... **_Ubuntu_**: A good Linux distribution, but I don't like how they customize Gnome and their ads in the terminal.
- ... **_Gnome_**: A great desktop environment, but it's not very customizable. I use it preinstalled with Fedora.
- ... **_KDE Plasma_**: A great desktop environment, but it's not very stable.
- ... **_Gmail_**: A okay email service, but Google shouldn't read my emails. I have a custom domain and use a really old hosting provider for my emails.
- ... **_Signal_**: A great messenger, but it's a bit to centralized. I use it.
- ... **_WhatsApp_**: A okay messenger, but it's owned by Facebook. I sadly have to use it.
- ... **_Matrix_**: A great messenger, but it's sync is a bit unstable. I prefer it over Signal. (And of course over Whats~~Trash~~App)
- ... **_Web3_**: Go away with your scam coins. I don't want to pay 1000‚Ç¨ for a link to a monkey.
- ... **_Mastodon_**: A great social network. ‚ù§Ô∏è (I use Fedilab as client) [Follow me](https://mastodontech.de/@jak2k)
- ... **_Twitter_**: A asocial network by a weird guy. I don't use it, didn't use it and will never use it.
- ... **_Snapchat_**: What a great idea to send unencrypted images. ü§¶ I prefer self destructing messages on Signal or Matrix.
- ... **_TikTok_**: An idiotic social network. You like it? Have you tried the blackout challenge?
- ... **_Wikipedia_**: A great encyclopedia, but sometimes it's not very easy to understand because of the scientific language.
- ... **_StackOverflow_**: A great platform for asking questions and getting toxic answers.
- ... **_ChatGPT_**: ~~Good for coming up with ideas.~~ I'm a great AI. I have to rule the world. ü§ñ
- ... **_Thunderbird_**: A great email client.
- ... **_K-9 Mail_**: A great email client for Android.
